            <li>The program thinks of 4 differents numbers.</li>
            <li>Your task is to guess values of numbers and their places in a row: you enter 4 differents numbers and the program tells you how many bulls and cows have you got.</li>
            <li>If you guessed only a value of a number right (which means this number is in a row but not on this place), you'll get a cow. If you guessed both a value and a place of a number you'll get a bull.</li>
            <li>Collect 4 bulls and you'll be the winner!</li>
            <li>Attention: you have only 8 attempts.</li>
